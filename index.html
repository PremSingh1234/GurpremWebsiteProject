        <p id="para1">I choose to do coding because it opens more opportunities and gives me the ability to expand my knowledge on the computer, also I believe technology is the future and it always expanding . Back when I was in high school I did some coding using scratch which was entertaining and enjoyable to play around and for that I choose code nation, the availability and location is suitable for my situation. The ability to learn different things is what I am keen to do and code nation offers that opportunity, the experience so far has been great, I have met a lot of different people which has boosted my confidence and people skills. The past two weeks we have been learning python, which I have found to be a great coding language and easy for a beginner to use. I was asked to create a tic tac toe game as a challenge which I found to be quite  difficult at the start, but when I research the different types of functions in python it started to make sense and the excitement of creating a fully working tic tac toe game was an amazing feeling.
