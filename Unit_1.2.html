        <h2 class="h2_1">Review the ongoing use of IT tools</h2>
        <p class=para3>Firstly I used Trello to plan my website, Trello is a fantastic and easy to use tool, it uses the kanban method and organises it so I can see what needs doing and what is done, It made planning my website really easy to do. To create my website I used Visual Studio Coder, this allowed me to create the website I planned on Trello also practice HTML and CSS which are easy to use tools. To create the layout of the website I used HTML, HTML allowed me to insert a background, links to other pages, text of information, list of information and an image. CSS allowed me to insert colors to background and texts, fonts, position of text/images, borders and GIFs. I used GitHub to make my code better by sharing it to other people who would input their different style of coding in comments, this is easy to use and helps me improve as a coder, I can also save codes I might have deleted  to use again. Git is a programme that I could open my coding for my website on any computer, this means I could update my code anywhere and would not need to download multiple files, this helps me to code without using different programmes and reduces the download of files. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_1">Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
        <p class=para3>Trello was appropriate to plan your website because it is easy to use and you can organise it to how you want, which will help you set up your layout for your website. Visual Studio Coder(VSC) was appropriate because it was what I used to create my website, HTML and CSS was what I coded with VSC, HTML was used to insert the text of information, links, images, CSS was used to insert the color, font and GIF. GitHub is appropriate to share your code so others can comment improved coding which I can use to improve my code which would ultimately improves my website. Git is appropriate because it is a programme that I could open my coding for my website on any computer, this means I could update my code anywhere and would not need to download multiple files. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_1">Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
        <p class=para3>My website strengths are that it uses a lot of functions such as inserting text, images/GIFs, borders on the links, links that open different pages, images that have a link connected to it. Also the uses of CSS such as using color on text and borders, using images and GIFs for my background, Creating a mini easter egg(click on an image and opens a link to a GIF) and all functions work effectively. Weaknesses are that the images/GIFs look stretched, I have a function where it was meant to make the links go white after they click on it but it does not. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_1">Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p class=para3>For my website I could have used more functions to tidy it up or make it look better, such as making the images/GIFs look better on the pages, change the cursor when you select a certain link, place images so that their where I wanted them to be, make so when they have visited a link    the color changes and make the headings move left and right slow motion to stick with the matrix theme. </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_1">Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
        <p class=para3>First I would test each functions I coded to see if they respond and are working, this will ensure that if a user does access my website they will be able to use it without errors, secondly I would have others review my website to see if they could uncover any errors, thirdly I would use tools that analysis codes that could potentially break or have an error, lastly I would use unit testing which test the codes method, class and component, if the unit working and tested across a range of valid and invalid inputs. </p>
