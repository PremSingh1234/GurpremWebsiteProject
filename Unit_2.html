        <h2 class="h2_3">Describing the content and layout for each page on the website</h2>
        <p class="para5">For my website I used HTML to code it and CSS to design it. For my website I themed it the matrix because it is coding related and also a great movie. On my website it starts with a page which is about me, it tells you a bit about myself as well as telling you why I choose coding, used CSS to design it so the background is an image of the red pill and blue pill scene and the text is purple so it is readable also I put links so that when you click on the links it opens the next page. Furthermore I created an easter egg which is an image of a red pill on the left of the screen and if you click on it a GIF opens up in a different tab. These links were called outcome 1-4 and had borders around them, outcome 1 and 3 I used the matrix coding scrolling down GIF as the background, I used white for the text, however for outcome 4 I put a different GIF as the background and made the text white. I did this to show I can use the different function in HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_3">Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <p class="para5">As a general rule, it is wise to operate under the assumption that all works are protected by either copyright or trademark law unless conclusive information indicates otherwise. A work is not in the public domain simply because it has been posted on the Internet or because it lacks a copyright notice. If you do use stuff on the internet, you have to make sure you have authorization and make sure to read the terms and agreements to any click to accept materials. If someone complains about an unauthorized use on your website, remove the offending material immediately. In the case of unauthorized uploads, downloads, or links, the webmaster should disable access to the offending material or link. This is not to imply that you should cave in to every complaint. However, you should remove the material for the period during which you investigate the claim and, if necessary, consult with an attorney. Attempts to "contain" the damage will likely help your case should it find its way into court. Continuing to use the offensive material after being notified may aggravate the claim and the chances of your being found liable and increase the amount of damages you may have to pay.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_3">Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
        <p class="para5">When your creating a website you need to take into account who is reading it, for example people who are visually impaired, I could create a narrator to help them read what is on my website or people who are hard of hearing, I could use videos that have a sign language interpreter. For people who have a disability in their hands or arms which do not allow them to use a keyboard and mouse, I could make the website use a voice command to help them go where they want on the website. These are the few implements I could do to make my website access to everyone.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_3">Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
        <p class="para5">When creating a website you will come across file types, while downloading files and viewing websites, you all meet up with many file formats. Most are common, and encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use. Here, we have a list of the file types, along with the applications you all need to get them going on your computer:
        <ul class="list2">
            <li>CSS - Cascading StyleSheet, CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look.</li>
            <li>DOC - Microsoft Word DOCument, Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably woould not come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you have not got a program that can open them.</li>
            <li>EXE - EXEcutable file, If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.</li>
            <li>GIF - Graphics Interchange Format, the most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images.</li>
            <li>HTML.HTM - HyperText Markup Language file, most pages you create for a website will be HTML files.</li>
            <li>JPG.JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group file, another very common image file format, mainly used for photos.</li>
            <li>MIDI.MID - Musical Instrument Digital Interface, midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They are usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your soundcard.</li>
            <li>MP3 - MPEG Layer 3 sound file, MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows download-happy file sizes and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>PDF - Portable Document Format, Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms.</li>
            <br>
            These file types can be used to create and style your website, for example using HTML to create your website, adding images or videos using GIF or JPEG, changing your text font, color and size using CSS, adding music using MP3. You can use DOC to make paragraphs of information your going to use for your website and use PDF to make it so it can transfer to different computers and platforms.
