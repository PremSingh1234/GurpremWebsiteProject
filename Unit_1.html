        <h2 class="h2">Purpose of IT</h2>
        <p class="para2"> The purpose of IT in modern business is Innovation in Business. Information technology fosters innovation in business. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution. Innovation makes businesses run more efficiently. And innovation increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity, all these will help the growth of a company and to make it meet its needs and wants. It’s important for each company to select their equipment specific to their business, for example what hardware and software is suitable for their business to succeed. This will ultimately save money well as make money.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2">A successful project</h2>
        <p class="para2">To create a successful project you need the basics IT skills, communication skills, people skills, initiative, problem solving skills, time management, team working skills and leadership skills. You also need to be very organized and assertive to a certain extent, you also have to be able to work under pressure. Being a digital project, you need to know how to use different software such as Microsoft, Google, Draw.io and Trello.Also which coding language to use is an important aspect for creating a successful digital project because you need to check if it runs the way you want it, it is clear for other users to use or update. This will allow you to set you digital project base, the different coding language you can use is python, jave, javascript and  C.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2">Planning and carrying out task using IT</h2>
        <P class="para2">A great way of planning using IT is using trello which uses the kanban method. This is useful because we can organise what's needed to be done, what is being done and what's done in separate columns and in each column you can give description explaining what is happening and other people could comment or update your columns. This is an organized way to plan for a task because it is easy to access depending if you are a public or private which is another great feature if you would only like yourself to see and edit or certain people to help
        (by joining them to the trello board) or making it public so anyone could help.
        <a href="https://trello.com/b/Hcj1QhBo/python"target ="_blank">https://trello.com/b/Hcj1QhBo/python</a> this is my trello board.</P>

        <h2 class="h2">Risks</h2>
        <p class="para2">If not planned or planned properly your digital project could be prone to some risks such as hacking, hacking is one of the main risks when creating anything digital because its giving another user the option to completely changing your digital project and ruining it. If the digital project is not secure enough it could create viruses to encrypt  your digital project making things not do what they should do or not working this can also expand on to you main laptop frame and could cause your laptop to not start or slow down. If it is a team project you could expect different opinions which you may have to consider and if not they can be some heated arguments end in failure, furthermore if you or your team do not pull their weight, this will cause your digital project to fail. </p>
        <h2 class="h2">Selecting and using IT systems and sofewares</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="para2">Computer systems consist of hardware and software. Hardware is the physical components of the computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), hard disk, monitor, keyboard and mouse. Software is the programs that run on a computer. When choosing a PC:
                <ul class="list1">
                    <li>Most importantly, know what you want to use it for and set aside a realistic budget.</li>
                    <li>The Processor - A processor, or "microprocessor," is a small chip that resides in computers and other electronic devices. Its basic job is to receive input and provide the appropriate output.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>RAM - Stands for "Random Access Memory". RAM is a common hardware component found in electronic devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In computers, RAM may be installed as memory modules.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Hard Drive -  The hard drive is what stores all your data. It houses the hard disk, where all your files and folders are physically located. A typical hard drive is only slightly larger than your hand, yet can hold over 100 GB of data. The data is stored on a stack of disks that are mounted inside a solid encasement. These disks spin extremely fast (typically at either 5400 or 7200 RPM) so that data can be accessed immediately from anywhere on the drive. The data is stored on the hard drive magnetically, so it stays on the drive even after the power supply is turned off.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Graphics - A graphic is an image or visual representation of an object. Therefore, computer graphics are simply images displayed on a computer screen. Graphics are often contrasted with text, which is comprised of characters, such as numbers and letters, rather than images.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Computer Software - Computer software is a general term that describes computer programs. Related terms such as software programs, applications, scripts, and instruction sets all fall under the category of computer software. Therefore, installing new programs or applications on your computer is synonymous with installing new software on your computer.</li>
                </ul>                
                Selecting what hardware to use was given to us by code nation which was a ThinkPad laptop, this is a good basic laptop to create a digital project, the touchpad was smooth and the sensitivity was high which allowed me to scroll faster, the keyboard was incredibly easy to use which was great for a beginner. However selecting which software to use was what I’m more comfortable of using which is Windows, Google and Microsoft. Which what the laptop code nation provide had, so it was easy for me to use and research what I need to.
                </p>
        <h2 class="h2">Choosing technologies that help me</h2>
        <p class="para2">Code nation asked me to create a Trello account, this has helped me set a plan for my digital project. I created three columns which use kanban method, in the first column I put tasks I need to do, such as the theme, information, text(size, colour, font), pictures/animations and coding. The second column will be tasks I am doing and contain the tasks from the first column and the third column will be things I have completed which also contains the tasks of the first column. You can also click on each tasks and give a small description of how you are going to do them. This is helpful for your self to take notes or for others to know what you want from them if it is a group project, furthermore others can comment on each tasks which helps because they could say they have finished this challenge.<br>
            I was also told to create a Github account, this helped me share my code to other people, who can comment on what they think needs improving, furthermore it is a social networking site for programmers, I can see lots of different people coding and knowledge on the subject to help me get better in coding. Git helps me save all my coding even unused ones, the reason for that is I might what to bring that code back and use it in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2">Legal guidelines</h2>
        <p class="para2">The final area GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation)  is set to impact digital marketing is data processing. Digital marketers will only be able to process the data they really need, requiring legal justification for why the personal data they have collected is being processed. When asking personal questions they have to go through GDPR to see if it is legal to do so. Also having a withdrawal for the user to decline their personal data at anytime. GDPR reshapes the way in which sectors manage data, as well as redefines the roles for key leaders in businesses, from CIOs to CMOs. CIOs must ensure that they have watertight consent management processes in place, whilst CMOs require effective data rights management systems to ensure they don’t lose their most valuable asset – data.
