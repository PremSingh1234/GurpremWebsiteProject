        <h2 class="h2_2">Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools</h2>
        <p class="para4">To gain the most efficiency when creating my website would be to use Trello to its full extent, add members in the course to give feedback and options by commenting on how I can improve my website, they could suggest ideas on the website or share coding they done to give me a better view of what I could do for my website. This also works for GitHub as well, when sharing my coding on GitHub, people with more experience and give me ideas and ways to create better or shorter codes, this will help me improve my skills as a coder. Being in a team would mean more efficiency because you would have different people with different skills, such as being good at coding, having good ideas, writing everything up,planning skills and leadership. Once everyone agrees to the website theme and team leader and each person skills is assessed, we could assign them to their job. For example, someone could plan the website on Trello, come up with ideas of how we could layout the website, search google to find appropriate images/GIFs to use on the website or code the HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2 class="h2_2">Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <p class="para4"> To improve productivity and efficiency you can:
            <ul class="list3">
                <li>Work in teams - assign them to their jobs where their most skilled</li>
                <li>Use Trello - Plan the website in detail</li>
                <li>Insert everything you planned on Trello to Visual Studio Coder - layout</li>
                <li>Use HTML and CSS to its full extent - use as much different function to gain an idea of what each one do</li>
                <li>Use better websites to help you code - W3Schools and GitHub</li>
                <li>Practice HTML and CSS whenever you can to gain more knowledge on it and apply it to other coding programmes that use HTML and CSS</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_2">Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
        <p class="para4">What I would do differently to improve my website productivity is to add members of the course to my trello board so they could see my ideas for my website and comment if  they had any suggestions they would like to comment to improve my website, I would also planned more so it more in depth and easy to transfer the ideas to Visual Studio Coder. Furthermore I would research different functions before hand and practice using the different function to improve my website.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="h2_2">Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
        <p class="para4">First I would test each functions I coded to see if they respond and are working, this will ensure that if a user does access my website they will be able to use it without errors, secondly I would have others review my website to see if they could uncover any errors, thirdly I would use tools that analysis codes that could potentially break or have an error, lastly I would use unit testing which test the codes method, class and component, if the unit working and tested across a range of valid and invalid inputs. </p>
